        "This project focuses on analyzing stock price data and financial indicators for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The goal is to group stocks based on their characteristics using clustering techniques and provide actionable insights into the features of each group.  \n",

        "The dataset contains information on stock prices and financial indicators such as ROE, earnings per share, and P/E ratio. Below is a summary of the data fields:  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ticker Symbol**: Abbreviation used to uniquely identify publicly traded shares of a particular stock on a stock market.  \n",
        "- **Company**: Name of the company.  \n",
        "- **GICS Sector**: The specific economic sector assigned to a company by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) that best defines its business operations.  \n",
        "- **GICS Sub Industry**: The specific sub-industry group assigned to a company by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) that best defines its business operations.  \n",
        "- **Current Price**: Current stock price in dollars.  \n",
        "- **Price Change**: Percentage change in the stock price in 13 weeks.  \n",
        "- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of the stock price over the past 13 weeks.  \n",
        "- **ROE**: A measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity (shareholders' equity is equal to a company's assets minus its debt).  \n",
        "- **Cash Ratio**: The ratio of a company's total reserves of cash and cash equivalents to its total current liabilities.  \n",
        "- **Net Cash Flow**: The difference between a company's cash inflows and outflows (in dollars).  \n",
        "- **Net Income**: Revenues minus expenses, interest, and taxes (in dollars).  \n",
        "- **Earnings Per Share**: Company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding (in dollars).  \n",
        "- **Estimated Shares Outstanding**: The number of shares of the company's stock currently held by all its shareholders.  \n",
        "- **P/E Ratio**: Ratio of the company's current stock price to the earnings per share.  \n",
        "- **P/B Ratio**: Ratio of the company's stock price per share by its book value per share (book value of a company is the net difference between that company's total assets and total liabilities).  \n",
